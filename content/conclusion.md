I was really fortunate to have been able to take up an opportunity like
this. I
realise that something like this is not neccessarily available to all, and not
everyone can actually make use of it. So while I have the privelege to be
able to avail this, I also have a duty, in some cosmic sense, to
actually make the most use of it. I hope I was able to fulfill that.

I came in with the expectation that I would get to learn to surf. That's
not really easy to answer that with an absolute. Surfing is not like
riding a bicycle, where you learn to do it, and then you just can. A
binary; yes or no. Surfing is more like dancing. There is always more to
learn, more to do, more to improve. I'd guess you can say I have set out
on my
journey to becoming a surfer, but it's only the start.

However, what I really got out of this journey, was everything else
apart from what I learnt standing on a board in the ocean. I learnt the
value of discomfort. How getting out of my comfort zone primed my mind
for learning lessons of all kinds. I learnt a lot about people. The way
they talk, the way they think, the way they react when being flung off
their boards for the fifth consecutive time.

More than anything, I learnt about myself. I learnt that I can push
myself beyond the limits I had lazily set. I learnt that I am capable of
some truly wondrous things. I learnt that I have the capability to
actually become the kind of person that I aspire to be.

And the most of all, I learnt that a single month can transform your
life.
