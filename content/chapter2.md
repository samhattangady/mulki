"Bhai, chalo, get up. We're going for camping tonight, se we'll all go to
the beach and chill by the campfire."

Khan is standing hunched over me, his hair lazily hunched over his face.

"Dude, I just got here this morning. Wasn't even able to sleep in the bus.
And lot of work was also there today na. I think I'll just crash today. I'll
come next time."

"Bhai, you've come to Mulki now. You need to take all the opportunities that you
can get. Who knows when camping will happen next."

My body screamed as I slowly rose. I didn't have to reach for the lights as
Khan's grin lit up the room for us.

"Awesome. Chalo, we are leaving in five."

It was the 31st of January 2021. I had reached Mulki a day earlier than
planned. Sleep deprived from an ardous bus journey, and exhausted from a sudden
burst of physical exertion, my entire being begged for some rest, but Khan and
his grin had other ideas.

I dragged myself over to the boat, and plonked myself down. The wait was
significantly greater than five minutes, as the boat slowly filled up with
people and equipment. Just as we were about to leave, there was a scream
from the shore.

"Wait wait wait wait _wait_"

A heap of bags slung over arms and shoulders was heading our way. And a bright blue
surfboard balanced on dreadlocks casually bouncing in the air.

As he noticed that the boat was indeed wait wait wait wait _waiting_ for him,
his pace slowed to a brisk walk. He took a couple of stops to adjust all his
bags and arms and shoulders, and then sauntered over to the boat.

"Walter bro. Almost missed the boat..."

Walter would have shrugged were it not for all the delicate balancing of luggage
and equipment his shoulders were already busy with. He carefully loaded his
things onto the boat, hopped in, and we set off.

The air was crisp and cool as the boat whirred and puttered its way over the
river towards the beach. The breeze blew away some of my grogginess as we
reached our destination.

I jumped out of the boat, and splashed around a bit in the shallow waters. Before
I could notice, a large sack of tents had been hoisted onto my back, and a finger
pointed me towards the beach.

"Just place this near the campsite. Oh and you'll need to help set up the
campfire as well."

We all scoured the beach for firewood and kindling,
mostly for the bragging rights that come with contributing the single
largest piece of wood to the campfire. The wood was soon piled up, and with a
little help from petroleum and a matchstick, we had ourselves a campfire.

As the fire sputtered to life, and the moon shown down on us with all its
glory, we all settled down on the soft beach sands. We scuttled slowly,
forward and backward, trying to balance the chill sea breeze with the warmth
of the campfire. Each of us in search of our own perfect pocket of cosiness.

With the campfire warming us up, and the conversations flowing in the breeze,
I could hardly have asked for more. But the universe has its own ways of
granting you the things that you never even asked for.

Turns out that Walter was actually lugging all that luggage around for a reason.
As we were talking, he casually reached back around, and opened up one of
his bags and took out a guitar. My eyes probably glowed brighter than the moon
for that one instant.
I discreetly scooted my sand-covered bottom and moved as close to him as I
could. He spent a few minutes tuning his guitar, and just noodling about.

And then, it started.

There is something transcendental about music in my opinion. It has the ability
to just lift you out of your present moment, and transport you to another time
and another space. This is especially true of music being played in small and
intimate settings.

There are some musicians who are performers. And then there are those special
few, who are the curators of moments. Architects in space and time, who are not
out to just play some tunes. They are trying to help construct a monument in
spacetime that everyone present can return to. They encourage people to
participate, and help build on those foundations. They move all their efforts away
from playing well and sounding good, and towards constructing an instance that
is special and unique, and a perfect musicial representation of what it is like
to sit by a campfire on a beach in Mulki, look up at the stars, and be wholly
and completely present in that given moment in time and space.

Walter was that kind of musician.

I would like to tell you more about that experience, but a moment that has
already been musically captured cannot really be relived through mere words.

As we headed back by boat, it was as though a a permanent marker had drawn my
smile.

"Kya bhai, was that better than going to sleep?"

The permanent markered smile was unable to change shape and form words, but I
think Khan had his answer.

Over my time in Mulki, I went camping many more times. There were many boat
rides and many campfires. But that first night will always hold a special place
in my heart.

### Lesson 2:
When an opportunity presents itself, it's not too wise to ignore it. Who knows
how many more monuments in space and time could have your
name on them if you live with an open heart and an open mind. Treat all
those opportunities like long lost friends, and embrace them before the
slip away.
