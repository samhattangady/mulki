"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

Adi looked up at me from his bowl of chickpeas, with that everpresent
mischevious glint in his eye.



"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."

"Hey Adi, I need to talk to you."
