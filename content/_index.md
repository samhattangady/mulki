I spent February 2021 in Mulki, a small town along the coast of Karnataka.
I was volunteering at a surf school, and in exchange for my tasks, I was
supposed to learn how to surf.

Once the month ended, I could not confidently say that I had learnt
to surf, but I definitely ended up learning a lot of other things.
