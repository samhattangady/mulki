<p class='chapter-heading'>Chapter 1: Initiative</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hey Adi, I need to talk to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Adi looked up at me from his bowl of chickpeas, with that everpresent
mischevious glint in his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go ahead bro, tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not here man, it&rsquo;s a little serious. Can we speak after lunch?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The glint in his eye dimmed by half a degree, but his smile seemed
unfamiliar with the concept of fading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh. <em>Serious</em>&hellip; Sure bro, let&rsquo;s meet outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was the middle of December 2020, and I was about two weeks out from
quitting my job. Back of the envelope calculations suggested that I had
a runway of about 36-48 months, and I was fully intent on grinding out
my shoes till my socks had some extra holes in them.</p>
<p>My first foray out of home was a three day surfing course in Mulki. The word
ecstasy does some heavy lifting in describing how surfing feels, but it really
isn&rsquo;t able to do it justice. Deep inside, there seemed to be a craving for
more, and three days was barely enough to get me started, so I had to have more.</p>
<p>Over the period of my course, I had learnt that they offered volunteering
opportunities, where they provided food, lodging, and surfing in exchange
for a vaguely unspecified set of tasks.</p>
<p>I was extremely interested in an opportunity like this. However, I also knew
myself well enough to know that if I went back home, and gave it some serious
thought, my expertise in finding excuses would flex its muscles, and it was
likely that I would be surfing Youtube videos as opposed to the gorgeous waves
in the Arabian Sea.</p>
<p>Hence the need for one <em>serious</em> conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dude, do you think I can volunteer in Feb?&rdquo;</p>
<p>When a pressure cooker is fully pressurised, it whistles to relieve some of
that pressure. Adi whistled. The glint was back with a vengeance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yeah bro, sure. You know what it includes right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Umm. I think so&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When can you get here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;1st Feb? I&rsquo;ll stay the whole month.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done bro.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Should I send a mail or someth&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nope. It&rsquo;s done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But one of the other boys&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s done bro. The <em>serious</em> business has been conducted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And it was done. I was headed back to Bangalore that night, but I had secured
myself a vaunted volunteering gig. Now it was only a matter of waiting
till February.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-1">Lesson 1:</h3>
<p>Sometimes, it takes a small burst of sustained courage, and that can completely
transform your life. So if you ever find a fear of discomfort blocking your
path, just breathe in, and take the plunge.</p>
