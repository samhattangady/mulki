<p class="subheader"> What I learnt when I was supposed to be learning how to surf </p>
<hr class="header-hr"></hr>

<p class='chapter-heading'>Chapter 6: Interaction </p>
<p>One of the interesting design decisions that was taken while creating
the surfing school itself (probably accidental), is that the rooms
themselves are not neccessarily the most comfortable space to spend
time. The common areas however, with their excellent views, comfortable
seating, and perpetual stiff breeze, result in exponentially more ideal
gathering spots.</p>
<p>Thus, most guests, and most volunteers tend to use their rooms mostly
just to sleep. Most of the free time is spent outside, in the common
areas, together. Suddenly <em>hospitality</em> has a tendency to become a
full-time affair. There are obviously two ways to tackle this issue.
Either you try to run away from it, or take the opportunity to make the
most of it.</p>
<p>For someone like myself, constant interaction slowly grinds me down. I
need my solitude. But hey, it&rsquo;s just a month. Let&rsquo;s see how much we can
push it. And amongst the hundreds of people I went out of my way to talk
to and interact with, there were some that just stood out.</p>
<p>There are some special interactions that you get to have in life, where
it just feels like you are sharing a mental bond with someone. There is
a sense that both of you are somehow sharing the same thought patterns.
You may or may not be starting from the same points, or reaching the
same conclusions, but there is a familiarity in the way that both of you
think, and both of you strongly sense that.</p>
<p>These generally tend to happen in intimate one on one conversations, and
very often with people you may not suspect. They start innocuosly, maybe
as a part of a larger group conversation, and slowly, the two of you
start steering it along a mutually unplanned yet inevitable path. You
lose track of time, and people who were part of it, slowly drop out of
the conversation until it is just the two of you.</p>
<p>There is something about these kinds of conversations provide a very
fertile ground for learning. In an ordinary conversation, we tend to
have our mental guards up. All the incoming comments are filtered
through a bunch of biases, and ideas are often ignored due to their
source. However, in one of these free flowing conversations, you
establish an atmosphere of intellectual intimacy, where you completely
open up your hearts and minds, and are fully amenable to the other
persons suggestions, because you understand that you share enough of a
common ground in ideas, thoughts and mental patterns that whatever is
being said is logical through your lens, just that you are yet to see it
that way.</p>
<p>I was fortunate to have a collection of these conversations over my time
here, and three in particular that really helped me broaded my horizons.</p>
<hr>
<p>We were sitting on the bamboo chairs outside. Both of us were the quiet
ones in our respective groups. It was the middle of the afternoon, and
after an intense session of surfing and a well-deserved lunch, there was
a calm energy floating over us, ready to descend on us at any moment,
and send us all scurrying for our afternoon naps. There was a slight
lull in the conversation, and he finally got the opportunity to get a
remark in. It piqued my interest, and I responded.</p>
<p>Suddenly it was just the two of us, and everyone else had disappeared.
His watch said that an hour and a half had passed by, but my subjective
experience felt more like a few seconds. That intellectual intimacy had
been created, and our conversations had been flowing from idea to idea
with a rhythm that felt in tune with the moment.</p>
<p>Somehow, we had not discussed his profession up until that point, and
when he mentioned it, it took some effort for me to stifle my shock.
Over the preceding few months, I had concluded that there were a few
professions that were an overall blight to society, a waste of talent,
and a culmination of everything that was wrong with a hyper
capitalistic system. And here was someone who was proudly saying that he
did one of these tasks.</p>
<p>Sure, I had met others who did the same, but I was able to easily
dismiss them, for one reason or the other. In this case, however, my
heart and mind was completely open, and after all that I had learnt
about this person, I couldn&rsquo;t just dismiss it out of hand. And so I bit
my tongue, and asked. <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>And in the following hour or so there was a lot of discussion again. I
had many doubts, and he was clearing them. He had gone through some of
the thought processes that I had, and others were new to him, but
eventually, when it came down to it, the main reason that he was doing
it was because it was something that he enjoyed. And I can&rsquo;t fault
people for enjoying what they enjoy.</p>
<p>So after that, I still had my list of professions that remain a blight
on society. But now, they all come with an asterisk. Context matters.</p>
<hr>
<p>We were sitting in the dining room. He is a part of the first round of
guests. He&rsquo;s a very talkative guy, and is just sitting around talking to
every round of guests as they come in to eat. I am busy in serving the
food, and am not really able to dive deep into conversation. Until I am.
And again, it is the same. One eternal moment later, lunch time is long
gone, and it&rsquo;s just us, chatting in the dining room.</p>
<p>This time, it&rsquo;s the company that he has just joined. I have a list of
companies that are evil. And it&rsquo;s two companies long. And he has
specifically opted to work for one of them? Again, were it anyone else,
it&rsquo;s a simple matter of just dimissing the topic and moving forward. But
not now, not with him. So I have to ask&hellip; <em>Why?</em></p>
<p>Again, lots of questions. Lots of answer. Lots of shared thoughts and
explorations. It boils down to the fact that the company does a lot of
good as well. And there is a lot more good that can be done. Sure, maybe
they are making some mistakes, but maybe the best way to address those
would be from within, rather than just putting it on a list of <em>evil
companies</em>.</p>
<p>So again. Asterisk added. Context matters.</p>
<hr>
<p>We are sitting out on the deck. The sun is about to set, and the whole
sky and river is lit up in the brilliant hues that only sunsets can inspire.
It is not a moment for talking. It is a moment for basking in the glory
of the universe. Once the sun has set, and the chill of the evening begins
to set in, he turns to me, and says, &ldquo;So tell me about you Sam.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This time, there is no extended conversation. No subjective time
relativity of any sort. It&rsquo;s just a single question, asked with such
sincerity, and with a gentleness that is almost forceful, all barriers
fall aside, and there is only openness. And it is tangible. And
everything just flows out.</p>
<p>He is a little older than I am. While the others seemed to be at similar
distances along the paths I was travelling, he felt like he was way
ahead in all aspects. That he had already had all of these thoughts that
I was currently having, and had managed to resolve all the crossroads
and paradoxes that I was facing. A well of wisdom at which I had
somehow found myself, and I was going to quench myself to the fullest.</p>
<p>He shared a lot of wisdom. Most of that is only for me. But there was
one thing he said though, that really put everything into place. All the
things that I had been struggling with, now suddenly had a framework
through which they could be understood and reckoned with.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Life is a balance between principle and practical.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In an instant, a lot of things fell into place. How had I condemned companies
as evil? Or professions as wasteful? It was all just an over-correction
on the side of my principles. As much as I wanted to live my life by
them, it&rsquo;s not a meaningful goal. There has to be a compromise at some
point, and we have to accept where we are going to draw those lines.</p>
<hr>
<p>There were a lot more people. And a lot more conversations. I learnt a
lot, and got to expand my horizons. They might have been uncomfortable,
but they were conversations well spent.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-6">Lesson 6</h3>
<p>Some of the most meaningful things we will learn in our lives will be
from other people. So whenever you find yourself having opened your
heart and mind, just be prepared for any wisdom that might flow your
way.</p>
