      <description>&amp;ldquo;Hey Adi, I need to talk to you.&amp;rdquo;
Adi looked up at me from his bowl of chickpeas, with that everpresent mischevious glint in his eye.
&amp;ldquo;Go ahead bro, tell me.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Not here man, it&amp;rsquo;s a little serious. Can we speak after lunch?&amp;rdquo;
The glint in his eye dimmed by half a degree, but his smile seemed unfamiliar with the concept of fading.
&amp;ldquo;Oh. Serious&amp;hellip; Sure bro, let&amp;rsquo;s meet outside.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Bhai, chalo, get up. We&amp;rsquo;re going for camping tonight, se we&amp;rsquo;ll all go to the beach and chill by the campfire.&amp;rdquo;
Khan is standing hunched over me, his hair lazily hunched over his face.
&amp;ldquo;Dude, I just got here this morning. Wasn&amp;rsquo;t even able to sleep in the bus. And lot of work was also there today na. I think I&amp;rsquo;ll just crash today. I&amp;rsquo;ll come next time.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;Bhai, you&amp;rsquo;ve come to Mulki now.</description>
