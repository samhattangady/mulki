<p class='chapter-heading'>Chapter 4: Ambition</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sammy bro, what happened bro?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I am suddenly snapped back to my senses. I look around and see that most of
the boys are no longer sitting on the verandah. They&rsquo;ve all headed
inside to participate in their chosen kind of worship to Lord Shiva.
It&rsquo;s just me and Guru now, sitting outside. It&rsquo;s the middle of the
afternoon, but we&rsquo;re sitting under the shade of some trees, and there is
a cool breeze keeping us there.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know man Guru. Nothing really went right while surfing today.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why bro? What happened?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know man. I think I may have caught just one or two waves
today&hellip; How did it go for you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He pauses for a second. Raises a finger to scratch his head, and a smile
starts to cross his face. Then looks back at me.
<br>&ldquo;I guess I caught two waves today. Hmm&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Damn. Doesn&rsquo;t that get you down? I mean we were in the water for almost
four hours, and we barely caught any waves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Guru looks me straight in the eye, and puts his hand on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Whenever I talk about Guru with the others, they always talk about how
much energy he has. But somehow I never saw it that way. Sure, he does
have a lot of energy. He can be found randomly breaking into song and
dance, trying handstands and somersaults, and running behind the kids
who live around the area. But I never felt that he was energetic. I always
found him to be in a state of a certain kind of calm. Like nothing can really
affect him. Like the ocean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sammy bro, we got to spend four hours in the water. What more do I
really want? For the last few years I&rsquo;ve just been unhappy and lost.
Until I found my way here. Now, everyday, my goal is to be in the water,
and try catch some waves. I got to do that today. What more could I really
need?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had spent the last few years working in startups. I knew what ambition
looked like. I saw it in all of my peers every day, and I saw it in the
mirror every morning. It was an incessant grind to do more, to get more,
to be more. More productivity, more sales, more features. Goals were
only set so that we can set more goals. There was no sense of
accomplishment when we actually accomplished things. Just restlessness to
set the next goals.</p>
<p>But here he was, looking me right in the eye, a prime example of an
ambition of a different kind. Something a little more simple. A little
more joyful. Ambition whose fruits can be enjoyed in the present as opposed to a
dangled carrot that we mostly just imagine about. After the startup hustle
ambition had ground me down, here was another ambition I could strive
for that would build me back up again.</p>
<p>I guess he saw the wheels whirring in my head, so he quickly clasped
both my shoulders and gave the a quick squeeze. <br>&ldquo;Sammy bro. Chill bro.
Surf if you can catch the waves, otherwise just enjoy being in the
water.&quot;<br> Then he quickly
vaulted over the verandah, kicked up a cycle that was lying there, and
sped off, popping a wheelie just before he escaped from view.</p>
<h3 id="lesson-4">Lesson 4:</h3>
<p>There is a different sense of joy and contentment when the goals we set
for ourselves are designed to maximise our own joy and contenment.</p>
