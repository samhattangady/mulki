<p class='chapter-heading'>Epilogue: Adventure</p>
<p>The universe works in funny ways sometimes. I spent my month in Mulki,
and was quite happy with the time I got to spend, and the lessons that I
got to learn. But as it turned out, my whole month was more of an
opportunity to study for a final exam that had probably been planned all along.</p>
<p>The exam came in the form of an opportunity for an adventure. But in
order to be able to actually see the opportunity for what it was, and
then be able to accept it, I needed to have learnt all the lessons that
were part of my syllabus.</p>
<p>I got to know my fellow adventurer because I was <a href="/chapter5">leading a kayaking
expedition</a>, and making sure I was taking every effort in
ensuring that the guests felt comfortable, and <a href="/chapter6">talking to
them</a>, so that we could all get the most out of our
experience.</p>
<p>It only happened because of a certain sense of <a href="/chapter3">patience and
persistence</a>, and a certain focus on <a href="/chapter4">making the most of the
present moment</a>.</p>
<p>And when the <a href="/chapter2">opportunity presented itself</a>, I had to <a href="/chapter1">say
yes, immediately</a>. And while I really didn&rsquo;t know how the
adventure would go, I
knew <a href="/chapter7">there was only one way of finding out</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of that adventure, I got to learn a whole lot, probably
even more than I learnt in Mulki. But none of that happened in February,
and none of that happened in Mulki. So it is a different story, for a
different time.</p>
