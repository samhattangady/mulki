<p class='chapter-heading'>Chapter 3: Patience</p>
<p>&ldquo;Vivek. How do you know which is a good spot to surf? Like where should we
be waiting, and how deep in the water?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, look out there. In the waves. See how they are coming in a
pattern? Those are called sets. Those are the waves that we want to
ride. So just keep looking out towards the ocean. Can you see the swells
coming towards us? &hellip; See there&rsquo;s one set right there.</p>
<p>Once you see that, just see where it breaks, where you see all the white
foam. That&rsquo;s where the wave has the most power, and that&rsquo;s where we want
to be waiting to catch the waves. You look confused&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Sam, just give it some time. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Vivek, when we&rsquo;re in the water, I don&rsquo;t really know how to judge which
wave to try to ride, and which ones to avoid. What should I do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, you have to try to see how good waves look when they&rsquo;re deep in
the sea, and then slowly get the hang of that. And don&rsquo;t worry if you
miss a few good waves, or if you try to ride some bad ones. It&rsquo;s all a part
of the experience.</p>
<p>When you see a wave, just take a call and stick with it. If you make the
right call, you get to ride a killer wave, if you make a wrong call, you
get to learn something new.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Sam, just get your reps in. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Vivek, I&rsquo;m getting the hang of reading the waves, but once it comes to
catching it, I don&rsquo;t know when I should pop up, and I keep messing
up&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, you need to get a feel for the wave. As the power comes and gives
a push to your board, that&rsquo;s the right time to pop up. So just be
patient on your board. You&rsquo;ll learn to sense the push of the wave, and
then you&rsquo;ll be able to pop up at the right time.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t worry Sam, just keep trying. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>&ldquo;Sam, I am struggling to get balance on the board. You seem to be able
to do it quite easily&hellip; What do you think is going wrong?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aruna, honestly, there is a lot of stuff to learn. There are
better people here who can teach you all of those things. But honestly,
if there is one thing that <em>is</em> wrong, it&rsquo;s that you just
haven&rsquo;t surfed enough.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>So just stay in the water and keep trying. You&rsquo;ll get the hang of it.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When things aren&rsquo;t going as you&rsquo;d like, don&rsquo;t worry. Just focus on your
efforts, and have patience. You will get the hang of it.</p>
